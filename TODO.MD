Must:
is app crashing when giving bad domains like http://rodmcnew4.com
https://rodmcnew.com show starting forever (SSL)

Should:
signup - captcha becomes "invalid" and you get stuck after second attempt
Get reset password working and show the message: "Your password has been changed. You may now login."
Make contact us form
add a test of the API server to third party up-time monitoring
refresh monitor detail with setinterval type thing
refreash many times in a row imedietly after creation
allow contacts to be CRUD'd

Could:
Actions files should start with lower case. they are not classes
show a more friendly message than "login failed"

Would:
@TODO move ?emailJustVerified redirect to after the # (do on server) - this would not change functionality, would just make URL prettier
