Should:
Make contact us form
allow contacts to be CRUD'd and uncomment "Email alerts (Email to SMS is allowed)"
Fix making a call to change password to null crashes the node app

Could:
show a more friendly message than "login failed"
focus on first form field when creating new monitor

Would:
run 3 initial checks instead of 2 to make chart look better
@TODO move ?emailJustVerified redirect to after the # (do on server) - this would not change functionality, would just make URL prettier
